# Carpenter

Server updater for the Crystal Caverns Minecraft server, designed to autonomously update the servers in our network.

While this is a standalone plugin, it should not be used by anyone other than us, as it is specifically made just for Crystal Caverns.

Carpenter is licensed under the Unlicense license. That means you can do anything you want with this code. Enjoy!

To build this project, just run `./gradlew build`, and the output jar will be located in `build/libs`.
